Q Given an array of n integers where each value represents number of chocolates in a packet. Each packet can have variable number of chocolates. There are m students, the task is to distribute chocolate packets such that:
- Each student gets one packet.
- The difference between the number of chocolates in packet with maximum chocolates and packet with minimum chocolates given to the students is minimum.
